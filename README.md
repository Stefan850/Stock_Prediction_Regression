# Stock Prediction with Regression
Stock Prediction using yahoo-API for stock prices and Regression Methods from SciKit-Learn


![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefan850/Stock_Prediction_Regression/master/example.png)


## Getting Started:
 - Install all dependencies (pandas, pandas_datareader,...)
 - Run file with Jupyter Notebook
 - Try new combinations of stocks and Prediction Methods

## Result
Regression methods find best correlations - and that is in this example usually the course of the previous day. To predict the future more features like Sentiment analysis are necessary that are more related to future than the past.

## Troubleshooting
 - If problems occur with pandas 0.25 install Pandas 0.24
